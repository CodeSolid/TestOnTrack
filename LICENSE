This code is Copyright(c) 2015, JohnLockwood and CodeSolid Software Development.

This is not open source software per se although it may have an open source
component with CodeSolid as the sponsor.

It is being shared on Github in the hope of attracting some folks who would like
to work on shared project as Employee Owners of the code.  An employee owner
will share significantly in both the development of the code [employee] and the
profit from it [owner].  We're inventing what I think is a new model here, but
I'd welcome being told, "Oh no, so and so is already doing that -- here's how
they did it".
